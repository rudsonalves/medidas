This project aims to develop tools to help with Experimental Physics classes (Basic Cycle). 
To this end, at first, the project will develop a set of programs specialized in performing 
numerical analyzes of the experimental data of the problems proposed in the discipline of 
Experimental Physics I.

The expectation is that with these programs the teacher will be able to quantitatively 
evaluate the results achieved in the experiments, allowing a different approach in the 
evaluation of experimental activities, without the need for reports.

The idea was not to eliminate the reports, but to provide students with more efficient 
tools to develop the mechanical part of the work, leaving more time for debate and analysis 
of the results found in the experiments.
